**being yourself takes courage.** finding yourself is painful, and standing up for yourself can be a lonely experience.

**vulnerability**, as nerve-wracking as it is, can be cathartic.

**do not be afraid of fear.** it will pass, and everything will be okay. the growth that you get from stepping up and speaking out is always worth it.

**do not settle for less than you deserve.** 

**respect** means taking responsibility for harm caused, and **love** means doing the labor of repair.

**stand by your values.** even when it means that people that you care about no longer make the cut.

**do not make yourself small to be loved.** saying no means saying yes to yourself.

**laughter is a salve for many wounds.** find joy. it is there, find it.

**rest.** your world will not fall apart if you don’t haul ass every second of every day to do the work.

**ask for help.** you do so much for others, let them be there for you, too.

**you are a good person.** you are worth showing up for, and you matter. you deserve space to exist.

**people care about you.** people *care* about you. you’re loved. *you’re so, so loved.*
