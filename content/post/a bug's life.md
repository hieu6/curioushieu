## does it hurt when a caterpillar transforms into a butterfly?

How does a caterpillar rearrange itself into a butterfly? What happens inside a chrysalis or cocoon?

**First, the caterpillar digests itself, releasing enzymes to dissolve all of its tissues. If you were to cut open a cocoon or chrysalis at just the right time, caterpillar soup would ooze out.**

But the contents of the pupa are not entirely an amorphous mess. Certain highly organized groups of cells known as imaginal discs survive the digestive process. 

It grows an imaginal disc for each of the adult body parts it will need as a mature butterfly or moth—discs for its eyes, for its wings, its legs and so on. 

*Some caterpillars walk around with tiny rudimentary wings tucked inside their bodies, though you would never know it by looking at them.*

**Once a caterpillar has disintegrated all of its tissues except for the imaginal discs, those discs use the protein-rich soup all around them to fuel the rapid cell division required to form all the other features of an adult butterfly or moth.**
