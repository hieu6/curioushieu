**radical vulnerability**, as nerve-wracking as the build-up is, can be incredibly cathartic. being yourself takes courage, finding yourself is so painful, and standing up for yourself can be a lonely experience. 

**do not be afraid of fear**. it’s just an emotion, it will pass, everything will be okay. the growth that you get from stepping up & speaking out is always worth it.

**do not settle for less than you deserve.** respect means taking responsibility for harm caused, & love means doing the labor of repair.

**stand by your values**, even when it means that people that you care about no longer make the cut. 

**do not make yourself small** in order to be loved. saying no means saying yes to yourself.

**laughter is a salve for many wounds.** find joy; it is there, just find it.

**rest.** your world will not fall apart if you don’t haul ass every second of every day to do the work. rest is important.

**ask for help.** you do so much for others, let them be there for you, too.

**you are a good person.** you are worth showing up for, & you matter. you deserve space to exist.

**people care about you.** people care about you. you’re loved. you’re so, so loved.
