## 1. build product knowledge 
clients expect sales reps to know products inside and out.

Overcome the objection: Demonstrate the unique value of your product, and give specific examples of how the product will solve a problem for the customer.

Need: “I’m happy with my current setup.”
Complacency, or an actual fear of change, can lead many potential buyers to dismiss a product before they’ve learned what it can do for them and their business. Remember that complacency is often a result of being ill-informed about a problem or opportunity, so if a potential customer seems complacent, you will need to take the extra time to describe the overarching problem or opportunity in depth.

Overcome the objection: If you can, bring up examples or case studies about their competitors who have made some recent changes similar to the one you are suggesting. Fear of change is a natural reaction, so you will need to calm the customer’s concern by showing examples of positive change within the client’s industry to provide a boost of confidence.

The best way to learn your products is by reviewing product demos, press releases, and documentation. Then, use them. Ask developers or product managers questions about functionality, use cases, and potential pitfalls. Write your own notes highlighting standout features and the problems they solve for customers.

## 4. Qualify prospects
Not all prospects are created equal. Before you can make a pitch, you need to verify that your product is a good match for the prospects you’ve identified. This requires a qualification call.

The qualification call collects basic information about need, budget, timeline, and authority that allows you to identify prospects most likely to buy. During the call, you should focus on the following key questions:

- What does the prospect need, and does this need align with your product?
- Do they plan to make a product purchase soon? If so, when?
- How much do they have to spend on your product?
- Who has the authority to make the purchase?

## 5. Analyze a customer’s needs
Once you’ve narrowed your list of viable prospects, take a deep dive into the needs of those who remain.

Set up another call with each prospect to further understand what they need and how you might meet that need (known as a discovery call). Keep in mind that 95% of buyers make purchase decisions based on emotion, so understanding a prospect’s emotional levers is key.

Below are a couple of probing questions that can guide this discussion:

- What pain points or problems do you have right now?
- How have these problems affected your day-to-day work or life?
- What’s preventing you from finding lasting solutions?
- If you implemented solutions that didn’t work, why didn’t they work?
- What would an ideal solution look like?

## 8. Nurture the relationship and upsell

If all goes well, your prospect is now a customer. Congratulations! But the sales process isn’t over yet. Satisfied customers provide a huge opportunity for cross-selling and upselling. As Alex Turnbull, CEO and founder of Groove, noted, “Upselling isn’t just a sales tactic; it’s a customer happiness tactic that can help you build deeper relationships with customers by delivering more value.”
