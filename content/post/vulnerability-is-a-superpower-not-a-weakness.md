i saw a series of videos recently about negotiating salary during the interview process. this big shot financial advisor mentioned things like, "don't bring up your mental health. that's not politically correct to say, but if you mention you have a history of struggling with mental health, they'll go with the other candidates." 

of course i saw this after i disclosed my own journey with mental health in recent interviews with notion. 

## what makes you resilient against hardship?
there's nothing that anyone can say that is more cruel than what my own mind can do to me. 

22 years with severe depression has taught me how to choose hope and curiosity in the face of fear of unknowns. 

## share your experience with learning something difficult
